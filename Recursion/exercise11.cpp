/*
 * Exercise 11: Finding your way through the labyrinth.
 * Given a two-dimensional array representing a maze: 0 is a free cell, 1 is a wall. Write a recursive function
 * that finds a path from the upper left corner (0,0) to the lower right corner (N-1,N-1), moving in four directions.
 * Expected result: the program should output one of the possible paths
 * (a sequence of coordinates or directions) from the start to the exit, or report
 * that there is no path if it is impossible to get there.
