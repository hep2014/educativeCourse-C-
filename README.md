## Course description (EN)

In this course, we explored 11 core themes that introduce foundational concepts in the C++ programming language.  
The total time spent completing this course was approximately 10 hours.  

**The covered topics include:**  

#### 1. Variables and Constants  
In this chapter, I learned about defining and using variables and constants. I successfully completed exercises to reinforce my understanding.

#### 2. Data Types and Input  
This chapter introduced fundamental data types in C++ and various input methods. I practiced using `cin`, `getline`, and explored type limits.

#### 3. Operators  
Covered arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators. I also learned operator precedence and associativity rules.

#### 4. Conditional Statements  
Focused on decision-making constructs such as `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch` statements, including nested conditions.

#### 5. Loops  
Learned about `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. I practiced loop control using `break` and `continue`.

#### 6. Functions  
Explored function declaration, definition, parameters, return values, and function overloading.

#### 7. Recursion  
Understood the concept of recursion, how the call stack works, and solved several recursive problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci).

#### 8. Arrays  
Covered 1D and 2D arrays, indexing, iteration, and basic algorithms like summing, reversing, and sorting arrays.

#### 9. Pointers  
Learned about pointer variables, dereferencing, pointer arithmetic, and their role in function arguments.

#### 10. Dynamic Memory Allocation  
Practiced using `new` and `delete` operators for memory management. Implemented examples with dynamic arrays.

#### 11. Structures  
Introduced to user-defined types using `struct`. I practiced creating structures and passing them to functions.
